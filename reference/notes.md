# Introduction

Describe what ex post lobbying is. Explain the interpretation You offers. Propose the alternative interpretation. Identify the key factual premise that makes the alternative interpretation counter-intuitive (i.e. error-corrections). Explain how you propose to establish it. Discuss some weaknesses in You's account. Conclude by pointing to implications of the different theories for understanding lobbying. 


# Establishing the Alternative Factual Premise

1. Estimate frailty, several approaches.

- Visual diagnostic (a la Christina)
- Estimate frailty... how???

2. Look at revision time only conditional on significant laws.


So what do we need for this?

Table with all laws as the units.
